description: >
  We all want to make films that are as good as they can be and that impact and
  inspire our audiences. But so often we find ourselves rushing and compromising
  our art instead of giving everything the care and attention it deserves. So

  innovation to occur? Hint... it's fuelling people for collaboration.
