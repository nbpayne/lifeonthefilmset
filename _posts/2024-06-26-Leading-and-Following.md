title: Leading and Following
description: >
  Working on a film set fundamentally involves interacting and cooperating with 
  other people. So how do you effectively lead and follow? In this episode we 
  talk about using "intent" as a way of directing others and communicating what
  you intend to do. We also touch on how to have "hard" conversations with
  others.
