title: Building culture
description: >
  You might think the experience and skills of important crew members determine 
  the success of a film project. But how many times have you been on a set with 
  a super capable crew who just can't work together? And have you been on a set 
  with an inexperienced crew who performed beyond their capability because of 
  their ability to work together with each other? This is the realm of 
  "culture". In this episode we talk about how to create culture in order to 
  maximise your chances of creating a film that is great.
