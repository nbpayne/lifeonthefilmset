We created the “Life on the Film Set” podcast as a way to embody what we believe about working in the film industry. Our values drive not only what we do, but how we do it.

## Our Values

### Passion for our art

We got into film because of a love of film as an art form. We believe in the power of storytelling to enrich lives and make our world a better and more harmonious place. We’re not just here to collect a paycheck, but to bring our whole selves to the pursuit of making something that will move and inspire an audience.

### Treat everybody with respect

We treat everybody on set with the respect they deserve as fellow human beings and creative practitioners. We are curious about them as unique individuals and relish the opportunity to teach them something and learn from them.

We do this not only because it creates more enjoyable working environments, but also because it creates the circumstances for us to achieve more together than we can as individuals. We also do this because it’s the right thing to do.

### Embrace excellence and new ways of doing things

When we go on set we arrive as skilled and passionate technicians who strive to be as good as our specialisation as we can. At the same time we realise that success is not just achieved through the capability of one person or department. We embrace the truth that filmmaking is a team sport and that success occurs when we work together with everyone else on set towards a common goal.

For this reason we are always looking for new ways of doing things and champion any and all opportunities to experiment, learn, and grow. We believe that when we do these things we will create films that are the best in the world achieving both critical, and commercial success.
